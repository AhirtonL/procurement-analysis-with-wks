<p class="p1"><span class="s1">MARKET OVERVIEW</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Tightened MMA supply continues boosting MMA prices upward by US$50~100 pmt in November, on the back that several MMA plants unexpected shutdown, and delay commission of Sumitomo Chemical C4-MTBE process 90kpta MMA plant in Saudi Arabia and Mitsubishi Rayon α process 250kpta MMA plant at Al Jubail in Saudi Arabia, together with environmental clampdown in China ahead of The 19th National Congress of China's Communist Party (from 18th October to 25th October), which made many MMA plants to cut production rate or delay new capacity commission before the conference. Hence, MMA producers struggle with low inventories, and are compelling to raise the price along with allocating MMA quantity to regular customer since September. In addition, it's heard that the MMA upstream INEOS Nitriles 545kpta acrylonitrile plant in Green Lake, Texas, USA still kept shutdown since the effects of Hurricane Harvey on 28th of August, which resulted in low production rate or shutdown of many MMA plants on the back of limited HCN supply. The situation of tight MMA supply couldn't release in America and caused the surge MMA demand from European and Asian market in Q4, which make MMA prices rising in November. On MMA feedstock side, the crude oil prices stay steady and made Naphtha prices keep at US$510~530 pmt, following with acetone prices at US$690~710 pmt. Methanol prices were slight down to US$330~340 pmt, and Propylene prices appears weak after shooting up in October and the prices were down to US$920~960 pmt. MTBE prices were slightly down to US$630~660 pmt. On the demand side, shortage of MMA to downstream market sentiment from ABS/artificial marble and polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) demand from the genera-purpose (GP) and light guide panels (LGP) grade kept low operating. Most customers understood the global MMA supply remained limited and MMA offtake didn't slow down. MMA prices for 500 mt above isotank order were settled in the range of US$2,650 ~ $2,750 pmt CFR for November shipment. The outlook for December remains tight and is most likely to have moderate increase.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">NORTH ASIA</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">China's domestic MMA demand appears stable but MMA prices were bullish amid limited liquidity, for reasons that less MMA cargos were available to China market and MMA producers reduced production rate for environmental issue. The 19th National Congress of China's Communist Party just closed on 25th of October, made several MMA upstream acrylonitrile makers shut down or cut down production rate during September to October. As a result, most MMA plants cut production rate by 20~30% owing to shortage of upstream feedstock supply. MMA prices have edged higher at RMB29,000-3,0000/mt DEL. It's heard that Longxin Chemical 50kpta MMA plant in Heilongjiang scheduled shut down for maintenance on 17th of October, and it is expected to restart during mid-November. In South Korea, domestic market demand remains healthy, but the tight MMA supply sends the MMA market prices soaring. MMA prices were offered at Korean Won 2,900~3,000/kg DEL. In Japan, tight supply impelled MMA producer under allocated basis. It's heard that Mitsubishi Gas Chemical (MGC) 40kpta MMA plant in Niigata shut down for 7 weeks from early October, and Asahi Kasei Corp scheduled shut down for 22 days maintenance on 12th of October. In Taiwan, domestic market remained sluggish, but local supplier has announced NT$1.5~2/kg increase in November on the back of tight MMA supply. It's heard that  Formosa Petrochemical Corp (FPC) 98kpta MMA plant at Mailiao will shut down for maintenance in November, and Kaohsiung Monomer Company Ltd (KMC) 100ktpa MMA plant at Kaohsiung will schedule shut down as well. It's heard that major PMMA makers kept 60% operation rate due to limited MMA supply. Prevailing MMA prices were at NT$75~78/kg DDP.  </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Downstream polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) announced US$50/mt increase in view of higher feedstock MMA costs. The spot polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) prices were in the range of US$2,600-$2,700/mt CFR. </span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">SOUTH ASIA</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">MMA supply in South East Asia continues to be tight against a backdrop of MMA cargo availability. In Indonesia, domestic market appears stable but local cast sheet makers keep low running rate on the back of MMA supplier allocated MMA quantity. In Vietnam, most cast sheet makers were still short of MMA supply and couldn't reflect the high cost to customers, they therefore ran their minimum production rate. In Thailand, market appears quite before Chirstmashas. In Singapore, it's heard that Lucite International 130kpta MMA plant are running well after 3 weeks shut down for maintenance. In India, domestic market demand was mute on the back of Hindu Diwali holiday. MMA prices stabled at US$2,800 ~ $2,900 pmt CFR in isotank.</span></p>
